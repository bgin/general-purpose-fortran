General Purpose Fortran Cooperative

This is a cooperatively developed repository of general purpose Fortran
modules and libraries.

This initial release is a collection of files output by personal build
utilities used to maintain the seed set of files.

Depending on interest the full set of files and utilities will be ported
to the repository.

Code additions are strongly encouraged (if this remains a personal
collection the purpose of the repository is essentially negated).
