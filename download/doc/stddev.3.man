NAME
   stddev(3f) - [M_math:statistics] given a real vector and the vector average calculate the standard deviation
SYNTAX
   function stddev(vector,n,avg)

   integer,intent(in) :: n
   real,intent(in)    :: vector(n)
   real,intent(in)    :: avg
   real               :: stddev
DESCRIPTION
   Clearly the average gives one number around which the n observations
   tend to cluster. And the standard deviation gives a measure of how the
   n observations vary or spread about this average. The square of the
   standard deviation is called the variance. If we consider a unit mass
   at each point x(i) , then the variance is equivalent to a moment of
   inertia about an axis through x(avg). It is readily seen that for a
   fixed value of x(avg), greater spreads from the average will produce
   larger values of the standard deviation s. The average and the standard
   deviation can be used jointly to summarize where the observations are
   concentrated. Tchebysheff's theorem states :

      A fraction of at least 1 - (1/k**2) of the observations  lie within k
      standard  deviations  of the average.  The theorem  guarantees  lower
      bounds on the percentage of observations within k standard deviations
      of the average.
OPTIONS

   vector(n)    the input vector
   avg          the average of the input vector

RETURNS
   stddev       the standard deviation of the vector
