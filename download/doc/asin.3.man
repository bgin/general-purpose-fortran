NAME
     asin(3f) - [INTRINSIC:TRIGONOMETRIC] Arcsine function

SYNTAX

   result = asin(x)

DESCRIPTION

   asin(x) computes the arcsine of its X (inverse of sin(x)).

ARGUMENTS

   X  - The type shall be either REAL and a magnitude that is less
        than or equal to one or be COMPLEX.

RETURN VALUE

   The return value is of the same type and kind as X.
   The real part of the result is in radians and lies in the
   range -PI/2 <= asin(x) <= PI/2.

EXAMPLE

  Sample program:

    program demo_asin
      real(8) :: x = 0.866_8
      x = asin(x)
    end program demo_asin

STANDARD

   [[FORTRAN 77]] and later, for a complex argument [[Fortran 2008]] or later
