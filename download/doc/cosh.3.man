NAME
     cosh(3f) - [INTRINSIC:TRIGONOMETRIC] Hyperbolic cosine function

SYNTAX

   x = cosh(x)

DESCRIPTION

   cosh(x) computes the hyperbolic cosine of X.

ARGUMENTS

   X  - The type shall be REAL or COMPLEX.

RETURN VALUE

   The return value has same type and kind as X. If X is complex, the
   imaginary part of the result is in radians. If X is REAL, the
   return value has a lower bound of one, cosh(x) >= 1.

EXAMPLE

  Sample program:

   program demo_cosh
     real(8) :: x = 1.0_8
     x = cosh(x)
   end program demo_cosh

STANDARD

   [[FORTRAN 77]] and later, for a complex argument [[Fortran 2008]] or later

CLASS
