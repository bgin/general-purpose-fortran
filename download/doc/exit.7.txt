.SH NAME
   EXIT(7f) - [FORTRAN:EXECUTION CONTROL] statement
.SH SYNOPSIS
   EXIT [construct-name]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.nf
  The EXIT statement provides one way of terminating a loop, or completing
  execution of another construct.

  If a construct-name appears, the EXIT statement shall be within that
  construct; otherwise, it shall be within the range of at least one
  do-construct.

  An EXIT statement belongs to a particular construct. If a construct
  name appears, the EXIT statement belongs
  to that construct; otherwise, it belongs to the innermost DO construct
  in which it appears.

  An exit-stmt shall not belong to a DO CONCURRENT construct,
  nor shall it appear within the range
  of a DO CONCURRENT construct if it belongs to a construct
  that contains that DO CONCURRENT construct.

  When an EXIT statement that belongs to a DO construct is executed,
  it terminates the loop and
  any active loops contained within the terminated loop. When an
  EXIT statement that belongs to a non-DO construct is executed, it
  terminates any active loops contained within that construct, and
  completes execution of that construct.
