NAME
   days2sec - [M_time] convert string of form [[-]dd-]hh:mm:ss.nn to seconds

SYNOPSIS
   function days2sec(str) result(time)

    character(len=*),intent(in)       :: str
    real(kind=realtime)               :: time

DESCRIPTION
     Given a string representing a duration of the form
     "[-][[[dd-]hh:]mm:]ss" return a value representing seconds

     If "dd-" is present, units for the numbers are assumed to
     proceed from day to hour to minute to second. But if no
     day is present, the units are assumed to proceed from second
     to minutes to hour from left to right. That is ...

        [-]dd-hh:mm:ss
        [-]dd-hh:mm
        [-]dd-hh

        hh:mm:ss
        mm:ss
        ss

         Where dd is days, hh hours, mm minutes and ss seconds.  A decimal
         fraction is supported on the seconds.

         An optional suffix of s,m,h, or d may be supplied to indicate
         seconds, minutes, hours, or days when a simple numeric value
         is supplied.

    use M_time, only : days2sec
    implicit none
       write(*,*)days2sec('1-12:04:20')
       write(*,*)'one second ',days2sec('1')
       write(*,*)'one minute ',days2sec('1:00')
       write(*,*)'one hour ',days2sec('1:00:00')
       write(*,*)'one day ',days2sec('1-00:00:00')
    end program demo_days2sec

   Results:

    129860.00000000000
