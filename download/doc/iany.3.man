NAME
     iany(3f) - [INTRINSIC:BIT MANIPULATION] Bitwise or of array elements

SYNTAX

* result = iany(array[, mask])
* result = iany(array, dim[, mask])

DESCRIPTION

   Reduces with bitwise or (inclusive or) the elements of ARRAY along
   dimension DIM if the corresponding element in MASK is TRUE.

ARGUMENTS

  ARRAY  - Shall be an array of type INTEGER
  DIM  - (Optional) shall be a scalar of type INTEGER with a value
  in the range from "1" to "n", where "n" equals the rank of ARRAY.
  MASK  - (Optional) shall be of type LOGICAL and either be a
  scalar or an array of the same shape as ARRAY.

RETURN VALUE

   The result is of the same type as ARRAY.

   If DIM is absent, a scalar with the bitwise OR of all elements in
   ARRAY is returned. Otherwise, an array of rank "n-1", where "n"
   equals the rank of ARRAY, and a shape similar to that of ARRAY
   with dimension DIM dropped is returned.

EXAMPLE

  Sample program:

   program demo_iany
     integer(1) :: a(2)

     a(1) = b'00100100'
     a(2) = b'01101010'

     ! prints 01101110
     print '(b8.8)', iany(a)
   end program demo_iany
