NAME
    julfit(3f) - [M_math:fit] linear least squares curve fits , destroys input arrays

SYNOPSIS
  subroutine julfit(x,y,ixn,itype,a,b,r2)

   integer,intent(in) :: ixn
   real               :: x(ixn),y(ixn)
   integer,intent(in) :: itype
   real,intent(out)   :: a,b,r2

DESCRIPTION
    use method of least squares to find a fit to the data.
    the expression being fitted is of one of several forms that
    have in common the fact that the expression will plot as
    a straight line if the proper axis type is selected.

     type  x-axis y-axis   significance of a and b

      1    linear linear   y=a*x+b         # linear function
      2    linear log      y=a*b**x        # exponential function
      3    log    linear   y=a*log10(x)+b  # logarithmic function
      4    log    log      y=a*x**b        # power functions:
                                                hyperbolic if b <0;
                                                parabolic if b > 0.
      5    linear log      y=a*e**(-b*x)   # a common variant of the
                                             exponential form.


OPTIONS
  x      = array of x values, input
  y      = array of y values, input that are changed to hold the output
  ixn    = number of points in arrays x and y to use
  itype  = expression being solved
          (1) Y=a*X+b
          (2) Y=a*b**X
          (3) Y=a*log10(X)+b
          (4) Y=a*X**b
          (5) Y=a*e*(-b**X)


NOTE: odd use of arrays specifically optimized for calling from USH

RETURNS

  a      = slope of linearized line
  b      = y intercept of linearized line
  r2     = correlation coefficient (1=perfect)
           In general, if the correlation coefficient is <0.5 the correlation
           is regarded as insignificant. If it is >0.8 the derived linear fit
           is considered highly significant.
