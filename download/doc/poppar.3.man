   It is equal to 0 if I has an even number of bits set and 1 if an odd
   number of bits are set.

EXAMPLE

  Sample program:

   program demo_population
     print *, popcnt(127),       poppar(127)
     print *, popcnt(huge(0_4)), poppar(huge(0_4))
     print *, popcnt(huge(0_8)), poppar(huge(0_8))
   end program demo_population
