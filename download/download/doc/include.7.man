NAME
    include(7f) - [FORTRAN] including source text
SYNOPSIS
    INCLUDE char-literal-constant
DESCRIPTION
  Additional text may be incorporated into the source text of a program
  unit during processing. This is accomplished with the INCLUDE line,
  which has the form

         INCLUDE char-literal-constant

  An INCLUDE line is not a Fortran statement.

  The char-literal-constant shall not have a kind type parameter value
  that is a named-constant.
  The interpretation of char-literal-constant is processor dependent. An
  example of a possible valid interpretation is that char-literal-constant
  is the name of a file that contains the source text to be included.

  An INCLUDE line shall appear on a single source line where a statement
  may appear; it shall be the only nonblank text on this line other than
  an optional trailing comment. Thus, a statement label is not allowed.

  The effect of the INCLUDE line is as if the referenced source text
  physically replaced the INCLUDE line prior to program
  processing. Included text may contain any source text, including
  additional INCLUDE lines; such nested INCLUDE lines are similarly
  replaced with the specified source text. The maximum depth of nesting
  of any nested INCLUDE lines is processor dependent. Inclusion of the
  source text referenced by an INCLUDE line shall not, at any level of
  nesting, result in inclusion of the same source text.

  When an INCLUDE line is resolved, the first included statement line
  shall not be a continuation line and the last included statement line
  shall not be continued.


  NOTE

          In some circumstances, for example where source code is
          maintained in an INCLUDE file for use in programs whose source
          form might be either fixed or free, observing the following
          rules allows the code to be used with either source form.

          *   Confine statement labels to character positions 1 to
              5 and statements to character positions 7 to 72.
          *   Treat blanks as being significant.
          *   Use only the exclamation mark (!) to indicate
              a comment, but do not start the comment in character
              position 6.
          *   For continued statements, place an ampersand (&) in
              both character position 73 of a continued line and character
              position 6 of a continuation line.
