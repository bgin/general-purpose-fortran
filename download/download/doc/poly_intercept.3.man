NAME
     poly_intercept(3f) - [M_math:geometry] intersection of a straight line and polygonal path
SYNOPSIS

  SUBROUTINE Poly_Intercept(a,b,x,y,n,u,v,m,num,ierr)

   REAL, INTENT(IN)      :: a(2)
   REAL, INTENT(IN)      :: b(2)
   REAL, INTENT(IN)      :: x(:)
   REAL, INTENT(IN)      :: y(:)
   INTEGER, INTENT(IN)   :: n

   REAL, INTENT(OUT)     :: u(:)
   REAL, INTENT(OUT)     :: v(:)

   INTEGER, INTENT(IN)   :: m

   INTEGER, INTENT(OUT)  :: num
   INTEGER, INTENT(OUT)  :: ierr

DESCRIPTION
   Calculates the points <U(1:num),V(1:num)> at which a line <A,B> crosses a
   polygon <X(1:n),Y(1:n)>, provided that number of points found (NUM)
   is less than or equal to the storage given the output vector <U,V>.

   Based upon routine PFIND from the NSWC Mathematics Library.

OPTIONS
   a,b     points ( a(1),a(2) ) and ( b(1),b(2) ) defining a line
   x,y     the set of points ( x(i),y(i) ), i=1,2,3,....n  define a polygon
   n       the size of the x(:) and y(:) arrays
RETURNS
   u,v     the arrays U and V contain the number of points at which the line
   m       the size of the U and V arrays
   num     number of intersection points found at which the line
           crosses the polygon in order (provided that m < size(u))
   ierr N  where N is ...
           o 0 no error detected
           o 1 if a = b
           o 2 U and V require more storage, i.e. num > m.
           o -i if the ith segment of the polygon is coincident with part of the line.
