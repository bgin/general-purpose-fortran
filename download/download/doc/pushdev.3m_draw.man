NAME
   pushdev(3f) - [M_draw:DEVICE] push current device onto a stack

SYNOPSIS
         subroutine pushdev(device)
         character *(*) device

DESCRIPTION
   Initialize a new device without changing attributes, viewport etc,
   but save the previously initialised device on a stack.

   Note, this is intended to completely change the device, it will not work
   if you pushdev() the same device that you are already running. (This will
   be fixed at a later date).
