NAME
   pendulum(1f) - [PHYSICS] calculate pendulum period

SYNOPSIS
   pendulum [-length Length_In_Feet ][-verbose]|[--help]|[--version]

DESCRIPTION
   Given the length to the center of gravity from the fulcrum (pivot
   point) of a pendulum in feet calculate the pendulum frequency in
   swings/sec, and how long the swing takes (the period of the pendulum).

   If the pendulum weight or bob of a simple pendulum is pulled to a
   relatively small angle and let go, it will swing back and forth at a
   regular frequency. If damping effects from air resistance and friction
   are negligible, equations concerning the frequency and period of the
   the pendulum, as well as the length of the string can be calculated.

   The period of the motion for a pendulum is how long it takes to swing
   back-and-forth, measured in seconds.  The period equation is:

      T = 2*PI*sqrt(L/g)

   The frequency of a pendulum is how many back-and-forth swings there
   are in a second, measured in hertz.  Frequency f is the reciprocal
   of the period T:

      f = 1/T
   Therefore in terms of the length the frequency is

      f = [√sqrt(g/L)]/2π

   The length equations are:

      L = g/(4*PI**2*f**2)
   and

      L = (g*T**2)/(4*PI**2)

   The generally accepted length of a seconds pendulum at sea level,
   lat. 45 degrees, is 99.356 cm or 39.116 in. = 3.25966 feet.

EXAMPLES
  Sample command lines ...

   # A 1/4 of a meter pendulum has a period of about 1 second.
   pendulum -length 0.820209980
   For a pendulum with length  0.820209980      feet
   The frequency of the pendulum is  0.996806502     swings/sec.
   Each swing takes   1.00320375     sec.

   pendulum -length 3.00
   For a pendulum with length   3.00000000      feet
   The frequency of the pendulum is  0.287753224     swings/sec.
   Each swing takes   3.47519994     sec.
