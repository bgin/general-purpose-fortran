NAME
   stuff(3f) - [M_calculator] directly store value into calculator directory for efficiency

SYNOPSIS
  subroutine stuff(varnam0,value,ioflag)

   character(len=*),intent(in)             :: varnam0
   integer|real|doubleprecision,intent(in) :: value
   character(len=*),intent(in),optional    :: ioflag

DEFINITION

   Normally values are stored or defined in the calculator module
   M_calculator(3fm) using the jucalc(3f) routine or the convenience
   routines in the module M_calculator_plus(3fm).  For efficiency when
   large numbers of values require being stored the stuff(3f) procedure
   can be used to store numeric values by name in the calculator
   dictionary.

   breaking the rule of only accessing the calculator thru jucalc:

   stuff(3f) is assumed to only be used when needed for efficiency and to
   avoid problems with recursion if a routine called by the calculator
   in JUOWN1(3f) wants to store something back into the calculator
   variable table.

OPTIONS
   varnam0   name of calculator variable to define or replace
   value     numeric value to associate with the name varnam0. May be integer, real, or doubleprecison.
   ioflag    optional flag to use journal logging. This string is passed directly to M_journal::journal(3f)
             as the first parameter. The default is to not log the definitions to the journal(3f) command.
