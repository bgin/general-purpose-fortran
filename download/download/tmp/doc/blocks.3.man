NAME
   blocks(1f) - [M_messages] write out 132-character string in large block letters

SYNOPSIS
   subroutine blocks(string,iounit)

    character(len=132)  ::  string
    integer iounit

DESCRIPTION
   Given a string up to 132 characters long, BLOCKS() writes out the string
   left-justified in large block letters 10 lines tall between columns 2 and
   131 for a string up to 10 characters.

   This can be used to make banners in program output files; it is also handy
   for making attention-catching notices in interactive programs. The routine
   has been used to make large delivery banners on fixed-type printers and to
   make eye-readable headers on microfiche.

   If the output unit number is negative, JOURNAL() is called instead
   of writing to a unit

EXAMPLE
  Sample program:

   program demo
      call blocks('NOTICE',6)
   end program demo

   would produce:

    >nn      nn    oooooooo    tttttttttt   iiiiiiiiii    cccccccc    eeeeeeeeee
    >nnn     nn   oooooooooo   tttttttttt   iiiiiiiiii   cccccccccc   eeeeeeeeee
    >nnnn    nn   oo     ooo       tt           ii       cc       c   ee
