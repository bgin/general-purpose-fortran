NAME
      rnum0(3f) - [M_calculator_plus] returns real number from string expression using JUCALC(3f)
SYNOPSIS
real function rnum0(inline)
    character(len=*), intent=(in) :: inline
    integer,intent(out),optional  :: ierr

DESCRIPTION
    RNUM0() is used to return a REAL value from a CHARACTER string representing
    a numeric expression. It uses the M_calculator(3fp) module.

    inline  INLINE is a CHARACTER variable up to (iclen_calc=512) characters long
            that is similar to a FORTRAN 77 numeric expression.
    ierr    error code. If zero, no error occurred
