NAME
   textweight(3f) - [M_DRAW:TEXT] Defines the weight of the fonts.

SYNOPSIS
       subroutine textweight(ival)
       integer ival
DESCRIPTION

   Defines the weight of the fonts. Currently, the predefined constants
   in C and Fortran are V_NORMAL and V_BOLD; which correspond to 0 and
   1. This is not the same as using linethickess to change the appearance
   of a software font. The font is redrawn multiple times with a slight
   offset to create the bold appearance.
