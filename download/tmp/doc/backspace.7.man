NAME
   BACKSPACE(7f) - [FORTRAN:FILE_POSITIONING] - backspace one record on specified I/O unit
SYNOPSIS
   BACKSPACE file-unit-number
   BACKSPACE ([UNIT=]file-unit-number][,IOMSG=iomsg-variable][,IOSTAT=scalar-int-variable][,ERR=label])
DESCRIPTION
   Execution of a BACKSPACE statement causes the file connected to the
   specified unit to be positioned before the current record if there is a
   current record, or before the preceding record if there is no current
   record. If the file is at its initial point, the position of the file is
   not changed.

   It is usually used when a program has partially read a line and then wants
   to go back and reread the line using the information from the first read.
   Backspacing can be very inefficient (Note that positioning to specific
   records in direct access files is typically much faster). It is usually
   better to read the line into a CHARACTER variable and then read from the
   variable multiple times using an internal READ, or parsing the string.

   Backspacing over records written using list-directed or namelist formatting
   is prohibited. It will usually work, but since the compiler is free to
   write list-directed or namelist output on a varying number of lines it is
   not supported, as it is not certain what data is on which line.

   Backspacing a file that is connected but does not exist is prohibited.

   If a BACKSPACE statement causes the implicit writing of an endfile record,
   the file is positioned before the record that precedes the endfile record.

   If the preceding record is an endfile record, the file is positioned before
   the endfile record.

OPTIONS
   UNIT     unit number of file to backspace one line on.
            A unit open for direct access or unformatted access cannot
            be referenced by a BACKSPACE.
   IOSTAT   a compiler-specific number that indicates an error occurred
            if non-zero.
   IOMSG    a message describing error IOSTAT if IOSTAT is not zero.
   ERR      a label number to jump to if an error occurs

EXAMPLE
  An example of a BACKSPACE statement is:

   program demo_backspace
   implicit none
   character(len=256) :: line
   character(len=256) :: mssge
   integer            :: i
   integer            :: ios
      open(10,file='demo_backspace.txt') ! open a file
      do i=1,100                         ! write lines to it
         write(10,'(a,i0)') 'line ',i
      enddo
      do i=1,10                          ! back up several lines
         backspace(10, iostat=ios,iomsg=mssge)
         if(ios.ne.0)then
                 write(*,'(*(a))') '*demo_backspace* ERROR:',mssge
         endif
      enddo
      read(10,'(a)')line
      write(*,*)'back at a previous record !'
      write(*,'(1x,a)')line
      !! writing new line will truncate file to current record position
      close(10,status='delete')
   end program demo_backspace

  Expected Results:

    back at a previous record !
    line 91
