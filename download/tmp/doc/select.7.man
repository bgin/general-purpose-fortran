NAME
   select(7f) - [FORTRAN:EXECUTION CONTROL] select a block based on the value of an expression (a case)
SYNOPSIS
1 The CASE construct selects for execution at most one of its constituent blocks. The selection is based on the
  value of an expression.

  R810      case-construct               is   select-case-stmt
                                                   [ case-stmt
                                                        block ] ...
                                                   end-select-stmt

  R811      select-case-stmt             is   [ case-construct-name : ] SELECT CASE  case-expr)

  R812      case-stmt                    is   CASE case-selector [case-construct-name]

  R813      end-select-stmt              is   END SELECT [ case-construct-name ]

  C809      (R810) If the select-case-stmt of a case-construct specifies
            a case-construct-name, the corresponding end-select-stmt
            shall specify the same case-construct-name. If
            the select-case-stmt of a case-construct does not specify a
            case-construct-name, the corresponding end-select-stmt shall
            not specify a case-construct- name. If a case-stmt specifies
            a case-construct-name, the corresponding select-case-stmt
            shall specify the same case-construct-name.

  R814      case-expr                    is scalar-int-expr
                                         or scalar-char-expr
                                         or scalar-logical-expr

  R815      case-selector                is (case-value-range-list)
                                         or DEFAULT

  C810      (R810) No more than one of the selectors of one of the CASE statements shall be DEFAULT.

  R816      case-value-range             is   case-value
                                         or   case-value :
                                         or   : case-value
                                         or   case-value : case-value

  R817      case-value                   is scalar-int-initialization-expr
                                         or scalar-char-initialization-expr
                                         or scalar-logical-initialization-expr

  C811      (R810) For a given case-construct, each case-value shall be
            of the same type as case-expr . For character
            type, the kind type parameters shall be the same; character
            length differences are allowed.

  C812      (R810) A case-value-range using a colon shall not be used
            if case-expr is of type logical.

  C813      (R810) For a given case-construct, there shall be no possible
            value of the case-expr that matches more
            than one case-value-range.

DESCRIPTION
  8.1.5      CASE construct
  8.1.5.1    Purpose and form of the CASE construct


  8.1.5.2     Execution of a CASE construct

   The execution of the SELECT CASE statement causes the case expression
   to be evaluated. The resulting value is called the case index. For a
   case value range list, a match occurs if the case index matches any
   of the case value ranges in the list. For a case index with a value
   of c, a match is determined as follows.

        1. If the case value range contains a single value v without a colon, a match occurs for type logical if
           the expression c .EQV. v is true, and a match occurs for type integer or character if the expression
           c == v is true.
        2. If the case value range is of the form low : high, a match occurs if the expression low <= c .AND.
           c <= high is true.
        3. If the case value range is of the form low :, a match occurs if the expression low <= c is true.
        4. If the case value range is of the form : high, a match occurs if the expression c <= high is true.
        5. If no other selector matches and a DEFAULT selector appears, it matches the case index.
        6. If no other selector matches and the DEFAULT selector does not appear, there is no match.

   The block following the CASE statement containing the matching
   selector, if any, is executed. This completes execution of the
   construct.

   It is permissible to branch to an end-select-stmt only from within
   its CASE construct.

  8.1.5.3     Examples of CASE constructs

       An integer signum function:

       integer function signum (n)
       select case (n)
       case (:-1)
          signum = -1
       case (0)
          signum = 0
       case (1:)
          signum = 1
       end select
       end

       A code fragment to check for balanced parentheses:

       character (80) :: line
          ...
       level = 0
       scan_line: do i = 1, 80
          check_parens: select case (line (i:i))
          case ('(')
             level = level + 1
          case (')')
             level = level - 1
             if (level < 0) then
                print *, 'unexpected right parenthesis'
                exit scan_line
             end if
          case default
             ! ignore all other characters
           end select check_parens
        end do scan_line
        if (level > 0) then
           print *, 'missing right parenthesis'
        end if

        the following three fragments are equivalent:

        if (silly == 1) then
           call this
        else
           call that
        end if
        select case (silly == 1)
        case (.true.)
           call this
        case (.false.)
           call that
        end select
        select case (silly)
        case default
           call that
        case (1)
           call this
        end select

        A code fragment showing several selections of one block:

        select case (n)
        case (1, 3:5, 8)        ! selects 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
           call sub
        case default
           call other
        end select
