DEFINITIONS
     MEAN

            A type of average, calculated by dividing the sum of
            a set of values by the number of values.

               mean = Sum(Xi)/N

     MEDIAN

            A type of average, found by arranging the values in
            order and then selecting the one in the middle. If the
            total number of values in the sample is even, then the
            median is the mean of the two middle numbers.

     MODE

            The most frequent value in a group of values.

     VARIANCE

            The average of the square of the distance of each
            data point from the mean

               variance = Sum((Xi-mean)^2))/N

            for a population, or more commonly, for a sample the
            unbiased value is

               variance = Sum((Xi-mean)^2))/(N-1)

     STANDARD DEVIATION

            The standard deviation is the square root of the
            variance.

               sd = sqrt(variance)

            It is the most commonly used measure of spread.

     SKEWNESS

            Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more
            precisely, the lack of symmetry. A distribution, or
            data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left
            and right of the center point.

               skewness = Sum{(X(i)-mean)^3} /((N-1)*SD^3)

            Where SD is the standard deviation, and N is the number of
            samples. Some sources will use N instead of N-1 or they might
            present the formula in a slightly different mathematically
            equivalent format.

               The skewness of symmetric data is zero

     KURTOSIS

            Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are peaked
            or flat relative to a normal distribution. That is,
            data sets with high kurtosis tend to have a distinct
            peak near the mean, decline rather rapidly, and have
            heavy tails. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have a
            flat top near the mean rather than a sharp peak. A
            uniform distribution would be the extreme case.

               kurtosis = ( SUM{(X(i)-mean)^4} ) / ((N-1)*SD^4) -3

            The standard normal distribution has a kurtosis of
            zero. Positive kurtosis indicates a "peaked"
            distribution and negative kurtosis indicates a "flat"
            distribution.

          Although often called kurtosis, historically the above expression is
          for "excess kurtosis" because three is subtracted from the value.
          The purpose of this is to give the normal distribution a kurtosis
          of 0. In recent times, the term "excess kurtosis" is often simply
          called "kurtosis", so consider that whether to subtract 3 or not
          is merely a convention, not a right or wrong answer. When using a
          particular program, you just need to be aware of which convention

          Again, another freqent difference is whether they use N in
          the denominator or the bias corrected N-1.
