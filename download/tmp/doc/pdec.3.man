NAME
     pdec(3f) - [M_debug] write out string with ASCII decimal equivalent vertically under it

SYNOPSIS
   Usage:

    subroutine pdec(string)
    character(len=*),intent(in) :: string

DESCRIPTION

     Given a string to print, PDEC() writes out the ASCII Decimal equivalent of
     the string directly underneath it. This can help you to locate
     unprintable characters or non-standard white-space such as a
     backspace character or tab character in input strings that your
     program could not interpret. On output, non-printable characters
     are replaced with a space, and trailing spaces are ignored.

     You read the numbers vertically.

     1. ignore trailing spaces
     2. print the character if it has an ADE of 32 on up
     3. print a space if it has an ADE of less than 32
     4. underneath each character print the ADE value vertically
     5. strings are assumed under 32767 characters in length.
        Format integer constants > 32767 are not supported on HP-UX
        when newer compilers are available use unlimited

EXAMPLE

   Sample program:

      program demo
      call pdec(' ABCDEFG abcdefg ')
      end program demo

   would produce (notice trailing space is trimmed):

     > ABCDEFG abcdefg
     >0000000000001111
     >3666667739990000
     >2567890127890123
