NAME

     set_exponent(3f) - [INTRINSIC:MODEL_COMPONENTS] Set the exponent of the model

SYNTAX

   result = set_exponent(x, i)

DESCRIPTION

   set_exponent(x, i) returns the real number whose fractional part
   is that of X and whose exponent part is I.

ARGUMENTS

   X  - Shall be of type REAL.
   I  - Shall be of type INTEGER.

RETURN VALUE

   The return value is of the same type and kind as X.
   The real number whose fractional part
   is that that of X and whose exponent part if I is returned;
   it is fraction(x) * radix(x)**i.

EXAMPLE

  Sample program:

    program test_setexp
      real :: x = 178.1387e-4
      integer :: i = 17
      print *, set_exponent(x, i), fraction(x) * radix(x)**i
    end program
