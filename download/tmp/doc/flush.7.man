NAME
   flush(7f) - [FORTRAN:IO] flush I/O buffers of specified files

SYNOPSIS
   flush file-unit-number

    or

   flush([UNIT=]file_unit_number,[iostat=i],[iomsg=string],[err=label_number])

DESCRIPTION

  Because the Fortran standard does not specify the mechanism of file
  storage, the exact meaning of the flush operation is not precisely
  defined. The intention is that the flush operation should make all data
  written to an external file available to other processes or devices,
  or causes data placed in an external file by means other than the
  current Fortran process to be available to a subsequent READ statement.
  This is commonly called "flushing I/O buffers".
  These actions are processor dependent.

  Execution of a FLUSH statement performs a wait operation for all
  pending asynchronous data transfer operations for the specified unit.

  Execution of a FLUSH statement for a file that is connected but does
  not exist is permitted and has no effect on any file. A FLUSH statement
  has no effect on file position.

  No specifier shall appear more than once in a given flush-spec-list.

OPTIONS


   [UNIT=]file-unit-number  Required. If the optional characters
                            UNIT= are omitted from the unit specifier,
                            the file-unit-number must be the first item.

   ERR=label                The label must branch to a target statement
                            in the same scoping unit as the FLUSH
                            statement.
RETURNS

   IOSTAT=scalar-int-variable  variable is set to a processor-dependent
                               positive value if an error occurs, to zero
                               if the flush operation was successful, or
                               to a processor-dependent negative value
                               if the flush operation is not supported
                               for the unit specified.
   IOMSG=iomsg-variable    message describing any error that occurred

EXAMPLE

        flush (10, iostat = n)
