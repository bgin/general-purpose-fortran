   This section uses $FILTER NULL to let a block of text be included
   in the source that is essentially ignored. The difference between
   this and a $IFDEF .FALSE. ... $ENDIF or $OUTPUT /dev/null .. $OUTPUT
   END section is that the -file switch lets this section get written to a
   file optionally when the $UFPP_DOCUMENT_DIR variable is set. This text
   could be markdown text, HTML, RTF, LaTex or some other format to be
   post-processed independently.

   The following $FILTER HELP section directives is converted into the
   HELP_USAGE() subroutine by ufpp. Optionally if the environment variable
   $UFPP_DOCUMENT_DIR is set the text is additionally written as-is into

      $UFPP_DOCUMENT_DIR/doc/cf.1.man

   because the optional "-file cf.1.man" switch was specified.

   This additional file would then typically be run thru txt2man(1) to
   create a man(1) page.
