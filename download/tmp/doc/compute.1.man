NAME
       compute(1f) - [NUMBERS] evaluate a calculator expression
SYNOPSIS
       compute [STRING] [-verbose]| [-help| -version]
DESCRIPTION
       Given any expression call the JUCALC(3f) calculator function
       and evaluate it. If no expression is present, read expressions
       from stdin until a line composed of a period(".") or end of data
       is encountered.

       Expressions are similar to Fortran77 syntax except powers are
       processed from left to right.
OPTIONS

       --help     display this help and exit
       --version  output version information and exit
EXAMPLES
       Sample commands:

        $ compute '(sin(30.33333)*2)**2+40.0/2.3-1.23e3'

        $ compute funcs # list available functions
