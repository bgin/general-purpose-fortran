    I was running short of time so I let the baked pumpkin cool flat on the
    towel and then cut it in 3 pieces and layered it will the filling!! SO EASY
    if you are afraid of making a pumpkin roll! and always a hit!!

    Fantastic treat to have for Thanksgiving week. I also make toasted cinnamon
    pecans to sprinkle over the roll and around the serving plate, which adds a
    nice autumn flavor to it as well.

    i added 2-4 drops of orange extract instead of vanilla, and it was
    excellent, made it seem a little "lighter" when eating it, and sooo
    refreshing.

    This cake was delicious!! I made it for Thanksgiving, and there was none
    left. However, I only added 2/3 cups sugar to the cake, and added an extra
    1/4 cup pumpkin. Also, for the frosting, I added a little more milk to make
    it more creamy. It was very good and delicious though.

    I make this pumpkin roll every holiday, and Birthdays and it is the best
    out there! I usually double stuff it with the cream cheese and walnut
    filling tho.

    I have been making these for years! I make several for the holidays
    starting with Thanksgiving and freeze them, this makes slicing so much
    easier. I can slice off what I need and keep the rest frozen, doesn't take
    long for it to thaw and be enjoyed. One thing is that the cake always
    cracks, sometime splitting completely when unrolling, not sure why but it
    doesn't affect the flavor

    I have been making these pumpkin rolls for years. I add crushed walnuts to
    some for a twist. I slice them and freeze them so that they can be pulled
    out and thawed with ease.

    THis is really not difficult to make, just time consuming. Preparation of
    the pans and towels before beginning is key. 1 Large can of Libby's pumpkin
    makes 5 rolls.

    I have been doing this roll for about 8 years and my kids love it. Gotta
    watch the calories though. Definitely not for a low fat diet. I also freeze
    my sliced rolls and put them in Tupperware to protect flavor. They come out
    awesome with a little defrost and are even great a little frozen.

    Tips for ease: Use a 100% cotton flat wrinkle free kitchen dish towel.
    Using a sifter, cover the towel liberally with powdered sugar--about 1/4
    inch. The more powdered sugar on the towel, the easier it is to unroll the
    pumpkin roll without cracks. Make sure you allow the roll to cool for at
    least 30 to 35 minutes before unrolling. If the roll should crack...not to
    worry....sprinkle the roll with powdered sugar and nobody will see the
    crack.
