NAME
   system_sleep(3f) - [M_time] call C sleep(3c) or usleep(3c) procedure
SYNOPSIS
   subroutine system_sleep(wait_seconds)

      integer,intent(in)  :: wait_seconds
         or
      real,intent(in)  :: wait_seconds

DESCRIPTION
   The system_sleep(3f) routine uses the intrinsic ISO_C_BINDING
   interface to call the C sleep(3c) procedure or usleep(3c)
   routine.

OPTIONS
    wait_seconds  integer,real or doubleprecision number of seconds for process to sleep.

EXAMPLE
   Sample program:

    program demo_system_sleep
    use M_time, only : system_sleep, now
    implicit none
    integer :: i
       !
       write(*,*)"Time before integer call is: ",now()
       call system_sleep(4)
       write(*,*)"Time after  integer call is: ",now()
       !
       write(*,*)"Time before real call is: ",now()
       call system_sleep(4.0)
       write(*,*)"Time after  real call is: ",now()
       !
       write(*,*)"Time before loop is: ",now()
       do i=1,1000
          call system_sleep(4.0/1000.0)
       enddo
       write(*,*)"Time after loop  is: ",now()
       !
    end program demo_system_sleep
