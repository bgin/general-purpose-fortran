NAME
     M_readline(3fm) - [M_readline] Calling readline(3c) from Fortran
SYNOPSIS
     Use M_readline, only : system_readline
DESCRIPTION

   The M_readline(3fm) module uses the ISO_C_BINDING module to create a
   binding to the GNU readline(3c) procedure from Fortran programs.

EXAMPLE

   The test program is basically just a read loop that prompts for
   lines of input read with readline(3c). You can edit the line being
   read with readline(3c) per it's documentation. At a minimum, you can
   probably move around the line with the left and right arrow keys, and
   insert characters by typing them wherever you moved the cursor to,
   and use the DEL/ RUBOUT key to delete characters and such. If you use
   a GNU/Linux shell with command line editing, you are probably familiar
   with readline(3c)'s function.

   It quits if you enter 'q' on an input line, and it dumps the history if
   you enter 'h'.

  the test program

   program testit
      use m_readline
      implicit none
      character(len=256):: line
      integer                       :: cstat
      character(len=256)            :: sstat

      write(*,*)' ____________________________________________________________'
      write(*,*)'  Your input lines are now editable using the GNU'
      write(*,*)'  readline(3C) procedure.  By default, up-arrow and'
      write(*,*)'  down-arrow go thru the history lines; left and right arrow'
      write(*,*)'  keys and delete and just typing characters let you do'
      write(*,*)'  simple editing. Far more input control is available.'
      write(*,*)'  See the browser pages and man(1) pages for readline(3c).'
      write(*,*)' ____________________________________________________________'
      write(*,*)' Enter text and then edit it. "q" quits; "h" display history:'

      do
         call system_readline(line,'readline>') ! read editable input line
         if(line.eq.'q') stop
         !call system(line(:len_trim(line)))    ! common extension
         call execute_command_line(trim(line),cmdstat=cstat,cmdmsg=sstat) ! f08 equivalent
      enddo
   end program testit
