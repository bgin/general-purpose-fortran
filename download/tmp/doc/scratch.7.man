NAME
    scratch(7f) - [FORTRAN:OPEN] where scratch files are typically written by OPEN(3f)
SYNOPSIS
    open( .... status='scratch')
DESCRIPTION
    Where files opened with status='scratch' are written is implementation-dependent.
    Often the file is unlinked so that it goes away unconditionally when the program
    starts, so in many *nix environments you cannot see the scratch file that is often
    used. So the compiler documentation should be referred to, but typically
    a scratch file is opened with a unique filename in one of the following directories:

      o in the directory pointed to by the environment variable $TMPDIR, if defined.
      o next directories pointed to by $TMP and $TEMP are used if the variables are
        defined.
      o if none of the variables are defined, then the /tmp directory is typically used
        on *nix systems, and the current directory is often used on other systems.

    This can be important if you are generating large scratch files, as you may want
    to specify they are created in a secure directory or on a high-speed server such
    as a Lustre file server or memory-resident file system. Consider

      o Scratch files are often opened using the current permission mask
        (umask) combined with possible operating-system or kernel defaults
        and file-system-dependent attributes, so make sure scratch files are
        properly secure
      o files are written in an area that you can write to and have sufficient
        space in
      o that the scratch space provides optimal performance
      o make sure the system cleans up properly
        when programs are aborted.

    The behavior is very system-dependent.

EXAMPLE:
   System-dependent example:

    open(newunit=lun,status='scratch')
    inquire(unit=lun,file=filename)
    write(*,*)'filename=',filename)
    end
