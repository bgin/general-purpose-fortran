NAME
  other2(3f) - [language] specialized routine for reading parcel files
SYNOPSIS
  subroutine other2(iin,iflag)

   integer, intent=(inout) :: iin
      This is the unit code the program should be reading from.

   integer, intent=(out) :: iflag
      if IFLAG=0 then ending reading of this file. Decrement unit count.
      if IFLAG=1 then open a new file and update unit code.

DESCRIPTION
   OTHER2() is a copy of OTHER() that can have filenames that are
   Calculator string expressions and that enables a program with a
   "parcel" command that reads from a direct access file to be mixed
   with the nested reads normally allowed with a call to OTHER().

   Currently only one program uses this routine but it's function is
   similar to OTHER() and it may be useful as an example for anyone
   else trying to implement a parcel command.

   o  OTHER2() can use string expressions for filenames because it
      calls RETRV2() instead of RETREV() to get the filenames from
      the dictionary.
   o  if IIN is negative, this is a flag that the read was encountered
      while reading from a "parcel" instead of a standard file.
   o  switches IIN  to + so read occurs, but keep sign to reapply at end
