NAME
   NULLIFY(7f) - [FORTRAN:STATEMENT] causes pointers to be disassociated
SYNOPSIS
  NULLIFY ( pointer-object-list )

   pointer-object               is variable-name
                                or structure-component
                                or proc-pointer-name

   Each pointer-object shall have the POINTER attribute.

DESCRIPTION

  A pointer-object shall not depend on the value, bounds, or association status of another pointer-object in the
  same NULLIFY statement.

  When a NULLIFY statement is applied to a polymorphic pointer, its dynamic type becomes the declared type.
