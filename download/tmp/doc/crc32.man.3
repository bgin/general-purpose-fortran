NAME
   crc32(3f) - [M_hashkeys] CRC (Cyclic Redunancy Check)
SYNOPSIS
   function crc32(a,continue) result (crc)

DESCRIPTION
This ia 32-bit version of the Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC).  This variant
of CRC-32 uses LSB-first order, sets the initial CRC to FFFFFFFF_int32,
and complements the final CRC.

The result should be in accordance with ISO 3309, ITU-T V.42, Gzip
and PNG.

REFERENCES
   Algorithms are described in "Computation of CRC" in Wikipedia.

EXAMPLE
  Sample program:

   program demo_crc32
   use M_hashkeys, only : crc32
   implicit none
   integer(int32) :: crc = 0
   character(*), parameter :: s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
      crc=crc32(s)
      print "(Z8)", crc
      print "(i0)", crc
   end program demo_crc32
