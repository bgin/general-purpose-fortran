.SH NAME
   CONTINUE(7f) - [FORTRAN:EXECUTION CONTROL] construct
.SH SYNOPSIS
   continue
.SH DESCRIPTION
.nf
  Execution of a CONTINUE statement has no effect.  A CONTINUE statement
  is most often used as a labeled line that is used in transfer control
  statements to numerically labeled lines such as GOTO. It is often
  very confusing to have executable statements on labeled lines; a
  CONTINUE statement eliminates the ambiguities that arise in jumping
  to an executable line. Preferably no target of a transfer should be an
  executable statement, but should be a statement like ENDDO or CONTINUE.

  CONTINUE was very frequently used as the end of a DO loop; ENDDO
  is now the proper way to end a DO loop.

         if(I.lt.5)goto 100
         J=3
   100   continue
         write(*,*)'J=',J

   end program demo_continue
