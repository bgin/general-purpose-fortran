<BLOCKQUOTE>
following three types of vector-vector operations are available:
Routines for scaling, copying, swapping, and computing linear
combination of vectors.
Routines for computing dot products between vectors and various vector
norms.
Routines for generating or applying plane or modified plane rotations.
The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) were developed to enhance
subprograms are portable, modular, self-documenting, and efficient,
you can incorporate them into your programs.
To realize the full power of the BLAS you must understand the
following three subjects:
- FORTRAN storage of arrays
- FORTRAN array argument association
- BLAS indexing conventions

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When a FORTRAN subprogram is called with an array element as argument,
<PRE>
M=11
N=13
REAL A(M,N)
COL = 3
CALL SUBR (A(1,COL),M)
SUBROUTINE SUBR (X,N)
REAL X(N)
</PRE>
In this example, the subroutine SUBR is given the address of the first
one-dimensional array, successive elements X(1), X(2), ..., occupy the
same memory locations as successive elements of the <I>third</I> column
A is available to the subprogram.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; BLAS Indexing Conventions</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The rest of this section describes the topics of manipulating array
sections, dealing with stride arguments, and handling backward storage.
<P>
A vector description in BLAS is defined by three quantities:
- array or starting element within an array, for instance the variable
X or X(I,J)
- vector length or number of elements, for instance the variable N
- the increment, sometimes called the stride, that defines the number
of storage units <I>between</I> successive vector elements, for
instance the variable INCX.
The notation for describing a BLAS vector in calling a BLAS subroutine
one dimensional array of length N, then (N,X,1) represents forward
storage of X i.e. X(1), X(2), ..., X(N) and (N,X,-1) represents
backward
then (M,A(1,J),1) represents column J and (N,A(I,1),M) represents row
corner of an array B of size LDB by NMAX, then column J is
follow.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Forward Storage</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As an example of the BLAS vector declaration using the above, suppose
array storage starting at X(1) with stride equal to INCX, ending with
x with components x(1), x(2), x(3), and x(4) are stored in memory in
the array elements X(1), X(3), X(5), and X(7), respectively.
This method of indexing, using a starting element, a number of
elements, and a stride, is especially useful for accessing
A is defined as
REAL A(M,N)
Then to access the 2nd row of A, one uses forward storage with an
X=A(2,1)
and increment/stride of
INCX=M
in a BLAS routine call with
X=A(1,3)
and increment/stride of
INCX=1
if A is defined as
REAL A(M,N,P)
to access the P elements of A at row 3 and column 4 one could call a
BLAS routine with starting address X of
X=A(3,4,1)
and increment/stride of
INCX=M*N
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=6>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Backward Storage</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some BLAS routines permit backward storage of vectors, which is
called backward storage starting from X(1 - (N-1) * INCX) with stride
logical vector components x(1), x(2), x(3), and x(4) are stored in the
array elements X(7), X(5), X(3), and X(1), respectively.
Note: INCX = 0 is permitted by some BLAS routines and is not permitted
vector of length N, all whose components are equal the value of X(1).

EXAMPLES

The following examples illustrate how to use increment arguments to

EXAMPLES
<P>
use the BLAS function SDOT, with the following declarations:
<PRE>
INTEGER*4 N,INCX,INCY
REAL*4 SDOT,S,X(1+(N-1)*|INCX|),Y(1+(N-1)*|INCY|)
S = SDOT (N, X,INCX, Y,INCY)
</PRE>
This sets S to the dot product of the vectors (N,X,INCX) and
(N,Y,INCY).
Example 1: Compute the dot product T = X(1)*Y(1) + X(2)*Y(2) +
X(3)*Y(3) + X(4)*Y(4):
<PRE>
REAL*4 SDOT,T,X(4),Y(4)
T = SDOT (4, X,1, Y,1)
</PRE>
Example 2: Compute the convolution T = X(1)*Y(4) + X(2)*Y(3) +
X(3)*Y(2) + X(4)*Y(1):
<PRE>
REAL*4 SDOT,T,X(4),Y(4)
T = SDOT (4, X,1, Y,-1)
</PRE>
Example 3: Compute the dot product Y(2) = A(2,1)*X(1) + A(2,2)*X(2) +
A(2,3)*X(3),
which is the dot product of the second row of an M by 3 matrix A,
stored in a
10 by 3 array, with a 3-element vector X:
<PRE>
INTEGER*4 N,LDA
PARAMETER (LDA = 10)
REAL*4 SDOT,A(LDA,3),X(3),Y(LDA)
N = 3
Y(2) = SDOT (N, A(2,1),LDA, X,1)

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; BLAS Data Types</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The following data types are used in the BLAS routines:
- REAL: Fortran "real" data type, 32-bit floating point; these routine
names begin with S.
- COMPLEX: Fortran "complex" data type, two 32-bit floating point
reals; these routine names begin with C.
- DOUBLE PRECISION: Fortran "double precision" data type, 64-bit
floating point; these routine names begin with D.
- DOUBLE COMPLEX: Fortran "double complex" data type, two 64-bit
floating point doubles; these routine names begin with Z.
