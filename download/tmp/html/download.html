<h1>Download Page</h1>
<h2>(for Fortran Command Line Interface Collection)</h2>

<p>
   There is one file to download for the libGPF library -
   <a href="../../GPF.tgz" style="background-color: yellow"
      title="
      It is easiest to pull all the CLI (Command Line Interface) sources
      code at one time in an archive file  because many of the modules use
      other CLI modules; and many included programs use multiple modules
      and routines.
      "
   > GPF.tgz </a>.
   This includes
<ul>

   <li><a href="../source.html" title="
      The what(1) command was run on the expanded source directory to produce
      a listing that shows what procedures are in which files: The what(1)
      command used is a customized version (included in this collection)
      that can generate simple HTML documents.
      "
      >the CLI (Command Line Interface) sources</a>
   </li>

   <li>  <a href="man3.html"> manpages for the <em>procedures</em> </a> as *roff and HTML </li>

   <li>  selected <a href="programs.html"> example programs </a></li>

   <li>  <a href="man1.html"> manpages for the <em>example programs</em> </a> as *roff and HTML </li>

   <li>a <a href="../Makefile">make(1) file</a> to build the source </li>

   <li> A start at manpages for the <a href="man3i.html"> <em>Fortran intrinsics</em></a> as *roff and HTML </li>

   <li> additional HTML documentation </li>

</ul>
</p>

</p>
   Assuming a recent version of gfortran is on your system you can
   download the file and place it in an empty directory and enter
</p>

<pre>
   tar xvfz GPF.tgz
   make
</pre>

<p>
   This will compile the CLI procedures and sample utility programs.
</p>

<p>
   For other programming environments you will need to change the lines
   in the Makefile that define the compiler command. Many Fortran 2003
   features are required. Recently, I have only tested with GNU Fortran
   (GCC) 6.4.0 .

<h3> MAN  pages:</h3>

<p>
   The man(1) pages are particularly useful when working with the
   code files when used with editors such as vim(1) and emacs(1).
   Several editors can now look up and display the man(1) pages for a
   routine from inside the editors. Place your cursor over a function
   name in the example programs and enter "K" in vim(1) to access the
   man(1) page for a procedure, for example.  Typically, you set the
   MANPATH environment variable to include the full pathname to the man/
   directory first. Something like
   <pre>
      export MANPATH=/home/$USER/CLI/man:$MANPATH::
   </pre>
   (assuming you installed the source in /home/$USER/CLI)
   will work, depending on what shell you are using.
</p>

<hr>
<h3> HTML pages:</h3>

<p>
   HTML documents are the most complete reference, as they include
   some higher-level overviews of the larger module files that are not
   currently included in the man(1) pages. Otherwise, the HTML documents
   are for the most part generated from the man(1) pages.
</p>

<p>
   Special HTML files
   use javascript to append groups of the HTML documents into a
   single manual.
</p>


<h3> Alphabetical listing of HTML documents: </h3>
<h3>Footnotes:</h3>

<p>
   Most of the code is maintained using a custom programming
   environment. The original source files are mostly ufpp(1) input files
   and/or HTML documents.  To eliminate the need to install this custom
   environment all the source files have been expanded to standard
   Fortran and C source.
</p>

<p>
   To simplify building the resulting collection of code a make(1)
   file has been automatically generated using makeMake(1) to compile
   the sources.
</p>

<p>
   Using a variety of utilities (primarily ufpp(1) and txt2man(1) )
   the help text is generally part of the source file and automatically
   converted to comments, flat text, HTML and man(1) pages.
</p>

<p>
   For those interested (particulary since ufpp(1) is one of the
   utilities included in this collection) most of the source is kept
   as ufpp(1) files.  ufpp(1) can write text blocks to various files.
   This allows basic documentation to easily be maintained with the
   source.  These blocks are then converted either into comments or help
   functions in the code by ufpp(1), but also optionally written to a
   common directory where they can be further processed, if required
   (they might already be HTML, which generally does not need further
   processing).  For simple routines the documentation is often written
   to look like a flat text version of a man(1) page; which has proven
   to be a good standard for documenting procedures, which many people
   are familiar with, and integrates into Unix/Linux environments and
   tools. The txt2man(1) utility is used to convert the flat files
   to *roff files; other files are run thru markdown(1) or LaTex(1)
   or other utilities as appropriate, based on the suffix of the files.
<p>

</p>
   The utility groff(1) was originally used to convert the man(1)
   pages to HTML and PDF but it has a bug as of this writing where it
   removes significant spaces when generating HTML; so the man(1) pages
   are now formatted using manserver.pl. Also see rman(1), html2man(1),
   and roff2html(1).  It sounds complicated but is totally automated
   just using a few bash(1) scripts to glue it together, and provides
   for an easy way to maintain documentation and source in the same file.
